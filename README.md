# SBUGram
My final project for AP course at university (Spring 2021)

SBUGram is a dead simple social media application, which supports for signing up, logging in, sending posts that can
optionally contain a photo, liking posts, posting comments for them, and reposting them (having their original poster
name on top of that - much like "Retweets" in Twitter). Users can also follow other users and see their post in their
very own "timeline".
